# Summary

In Bayesian inference the _posterior distribution_ is the probability distribution over the model parameters resulting from the prior distribution and the likelihood. One can compute integrals over this distribution to obtain quantities of interest, such as the posterior mean and variance, or credible uncertainty regions. However as these integrals are often intractable for problems of interest they therefore require numerical methods to approximate them.

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is currently the gold standard for approximating integrals needed in Bayesian inference. However as these algorithms become prohibitively expensive for large datasets, stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC) [@nemeth2021stochastic; @NIPS2015_Ma_complete_recipe] is a popular approach to approximate these integrals in these cases. This class of scalable algorithms uses data subsampling techniques to approximate gradient based sampling algorithms, and are regularly used to fit statistical models or Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). The SGMCMC literature develops new algorithms by finding novel gradient estimation techniques, designing more efficient diffusions, and finding more stable numerical discretisations to these diffusions. SGMCMCJax is a lightweight library that is designed to allow the user to innovate along these lines or use one of the gradient-based SGMCMC algorithms already included in the library. This makes SGMCMCJax very well suited for both research purposes and practical applications.


# Statement of need

SGMCMCJax is a Python package written in the popular JAX library [@jax2018github]. Although there are libraries for SGMCMC algorithms in other languages and automatic differentiation frameworks [@baker2019sgmcmc; @tensorflow2015-whitepaper], there is no mature library for the JAX ecosystem. However as this has become a popular framework for machine learning and scientific computing, this gap has become more noticeable. As SGMCMC algorithms are a standard tool to train Bayesian neural networks as well as statistical models with large datasets, we have written this library of samplers to fill this gap.

SGMCMCJax uses JAX to perform automatic differentiation and compilation to XLA. The use of JAX allows the SGMCMCJax library to effortlessly run on GPUs and TPUs, which is essential for large models such as BNNs. As a result, the library uses an easy-to-use interface and provides very competitive speed performance. SGMCMCJax is designed in a modular framework allowing users to simply run one of its many algorithms or to create new algorithms for research purposes by using the existing algorithms as building blocks. Furthermore, SGMCMCJax can integrate easily with other codebases within the JAX ecosystem such as Flax, a neural network library for JAX. As SGMCMC algorithms are often used to train BNNs which are usually written using frameworks such as Flax, having a library that can interact with these packages is essential.

There also exists many probabilistic programming languagues (PPLs) such as NumPyro, Stan, or PyMC, which allow users to define models and sample from them using advanced MCMC algorithms. However these PPLs don't usually include SGMCMC algorithms in their inference toolkit which are useful for dealing with large datasets. In contrast, SGMCMCJax has a wide range of standard and state-of-the-art SGMCMC algorithms, does not include a modelling language, and is designed in a modular way that allows users to develop new sampling algorithms. As a result, this lightweight library fills the need for these scalable algorithms, and can be used to sample from models defined using these PPLs.


# Software requirements and external usage

SGMCMCJax is written using JAX [@jax2018github] and relies on some aspects of the Python ecosystem such as NumPy [@harris2020array].

Although SGMCMCJax is a recent library it has already been used in a research paper [@coullon2021efficient] as well as used in the [code to accompany](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml) the book "Machine learning: a probabilistic perspective" [@murphy2023].
